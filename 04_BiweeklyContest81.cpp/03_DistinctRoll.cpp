// You are given an integer n. You roll a fair 6-sided dice n times. Determine 
// the total number of distinct sequences of rolls possible such that the following 
// conditions are satisfied:

// The greatest common divisor of any adjacent values in the sequence is equal to 1.
// There is at least a gap of 2 rolls between equal valued rolls. More formally, 
// if the value of the ith roll is equal to the value of the jth roll, then 
// abs(i - j) > 2.
// Return the total number of distinct sequences possible. Since the answer may 
// be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

// Two sequences are considered distinct if at least one element is different.
